Store Online Application
Day 01:
- Design a small web application to allow user to view list of all products available
as well as adding new product
  + List products from a provided json object (model, year, price, producer, available)
  + Allow (+/-) button to update number of available products remaining.
  + Provide filter for products on those fields by inputting to a text field
  + Provide Add button along with 4 text field to add new product
  
  Note: use ng-repeat to loop over the product list

Day 02:
- Create a template directive to wrap contents inside ng-repeat so that we can use that directive in other places
- The template should receive dynamic product info as well as handle (+/-) button

Day 03:
- Create a link on producer column, click on this will navigate to producer page with some basic information
- Add a Back button to return to product list page
